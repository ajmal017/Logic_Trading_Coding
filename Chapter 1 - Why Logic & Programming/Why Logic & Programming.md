Why coding? This is a valid question, since people have been making money trading equities for more than 100 years, and they didn’t have computers all the time. Technology doesn’t make use smarter, but it can really help us consume more information, and it can help us search through a lot more information that we can as human beings.

Do you like Google? 
<li> In the same way you can build your own news stream and search for the topics you are interested in.</li> 
<li> Do you like a certain type of chart? How many charts can you study on your own before you get a headache? A program could check the WHOLE market for specific patterns in less than a minute … that is over 5000 stocks.</li>
<li> Do you have an idea and want to test it and see how it worked in the past? Or how it works under certain conditions? Well, good luck doing that without coding. </li>
<br>
And the list is really long. I could group the type of technologies into the following categories:
<li><b>Search technologies</b> - they help discover signals or ideas </li>
<li><b>Prototyping and testing</b> - they help create algos and then test such algos to see if and how they work</li>
<li><b>Automating trading</b> - this is true for programs that go beyond simple conditional orders. Imagine you want to execute an order subject to the pricing of a different stock, or subject to a more complicated formula calculation. You will have to build your own program for this, as the broker platform does not support such a level of complexity. And you’ll need to familiarize yourself with working in async.</li>
<li><b>Independent trading machines</b> - these would be fully independent, able to trade on their own without any human interaction or supervision. They are outside the scope of this book.</li>

So let’s get started!
