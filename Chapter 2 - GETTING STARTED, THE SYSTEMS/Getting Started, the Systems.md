I believe the most important part is logical thinking, the capability to structure your thoughts/thinking/ideas into concrete steps, so that you can translate them into coding. It really comes down to understanding the input data, the targeted output, and how to transform the inputs into outputs. This is all the thinking process that happens before the actual programming.

The bare minimum to be able to understand the code/book is:
<li><b>Understanding and experience of using Python.</b> You donâ€™t need to be an expert, just understand how things actually work.</li>
<li><b>Access to data.</b></li> 
<li><b>Broker connectivity,</b> if you actually want to have your machine connect to the broker</li>
