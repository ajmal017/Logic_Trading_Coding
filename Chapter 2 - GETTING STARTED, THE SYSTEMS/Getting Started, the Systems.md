I believe the most important part is logical thinking, the capability to structure your thoughts/thinking/ideas into concrete steps, to build the flow of such steps, so that you can translate them into coding. It's all about understanding the input data, the targeted output, and how to transform the inputs into outputs. As such, I will try in most cases to provide both the logical schema flow that canbe used for any programming language, and then the python code.

Current chapter will introduce the minimum necessary tools to get your started, together with <i>the relevant logic flow and code examples.</i>
<li><b>Understanding and experience of using Python</b> for the code examples here, or anohter programming language that you like and use. You donâ€™t need to be an expert, just understand how things actually work. Any programming language works actually, I am just familiar with Python. Will be using Python3 to be more specific.</li>
<li><b>Understand how asynchronous proccesses</b> work. There are processes running on your machine and processes running on the broker side. Your program execution speed and capabilities may depend on the broker side process execution, depending on how deep the programs are integrated.</li>
<li><b>Access to data.</b>There are plenty of resources where you can get access to data for free or for a fee, depending on your needs. I'll just be giving a few examples below.</li> 
<li><b>Broker connectivity,</b> if you actually want to have your machine connect to the broker.</li>
<li><b>Your own backtesting machine</b> that you can use to verify and finetune your own ideas. You can already use online free resources like Quantopian, but if you can get your own data, better build your own backtesting machine. It's easy and allows you for maximum flexibility in creating new strategies.</li>
