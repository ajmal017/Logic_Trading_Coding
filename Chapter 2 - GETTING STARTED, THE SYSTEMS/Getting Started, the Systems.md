I believe the most important part is logical thinking, the capability to structure your thoughts/thinking/ideas into concrete steps, so that you can translate them into coding. It really comes down to understanding the input data, the targeted output, and how to transform the inputs into outputs. This is all the thinking process that happens before the actual programming.

Current chapter will introduce the minimum necessary tools to get your started, together with <i>the relevant code examples.</i>
<li><b>Understanding and experience of using Python.</b> You donâ€™t need to be an expert, just understand how things actually work.</li>
<li><b>Access to data.</b></li> 
<li><b>Broker connectivity,</b> if you actually want to have your machine connect to the broker</li>
<li><b>Your own backtesting machine</b> that you can use to verify and finetune your own ideas. You can already use online free resources like Quantopian, but if you can get your own data, better build your own backtesting machine. It's easy and allows you for maximum flexibility in creating new strategies.</li>
