# Logic_Trading_Coding

<h1><b> UNDER CONSTRUCTION </b></h1>

Build your own tools and algos, and start trading!

INTRODUCTION

The book is for people interested in building their own tools and technology to automate parts of or all trading, from ideas/information search to idea generation and actual trading. The book is built around logic and code examples. Each chapter is independent of each other, so people can jump to the topic they like, provided they understand/master the necessary knowledge required. 

The book is modular in itself, available under license Apache 2.0 - so feel free to use it anyway you like. Each chapter will have its own code and examples. Will try to make this as code rich as possible, and the book as short textually as possible - the idea is to practice/trade, not fall asleep reading. The structure of every chapter/subchapter is very simple:
<li>Concept introduction,</li> 
<li>code implementation logic,</li> 
<li>code examples thereof. </li>

<br>And everything as short as possible - as a sales by background, I know that I lost a client if I didn’t make an impression in the first 6 seconds.

Do you need to learn how to code? That would be best and highly recommended. But if you cannot code, it is very easy to hire somebody for you nowadays, and I’ve tried to make the logic here as easy to understand as possible in case you need to hire a programmer for your needs.

Why HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you actually code, or learn coding? Because coding is like talking, just another language, only that you use it to “talk” to machines. Imagine using a translator for every word you have to say. Would the translator be able to guess your thinking in order to present your actual message to the audience/other person? I doubt it. The same with coding. Easy to hire somebody to do the coding for you, but there is a reason IT projects have kept failing or falling behind over the last 20 years: no programmer can directly read your mind. And TRADING is all about your mind and beliefs.
